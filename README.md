# Employee-Management-Angular
Overview:

The Employee Management project consists of an admin in which admin user can login and add, edit managers profile and a website that enables a manager to list, add, edit an employee details.

This application is based on python, django and django REST framework, Angular and typescript, HTML, CSS, Angular-Material.

In this application, I have created a web view which consists of signup, login, employee list, add-employee, edit-employee screens.
